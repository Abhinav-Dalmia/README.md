My name is Abhinav Dalmia, and I am currently a first-year student at Sir MVIT, pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Science. I have a keen interest in web development, with a particular focus on HTML and CSS. Alongside my web development skills, I have also learned the basics of programming in C and Java, which has helped me build a strong foundation in computer science and software development. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and continuously improving my skills in this ever-evolving field.
